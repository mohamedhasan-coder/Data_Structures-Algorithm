## Number of Digits (Coding Ninjas)

<P>Difficulty : Easy</P>

<P>Ninja want to add coding to his skill set so he started learning it. On the first day, he stuck to a problem in which he has given a long integer ‘X’ and had to count the number of digits in it.

Ninja called you for help as you are his only friend. Help him to solve the problem.

</p>

### EXAMPLE:
<p>
Input: 'X' = 2

Output: 1

As only one digit is ‘2’ present in ‘X’ so answer is ‘1’.
</P>

### Constraints :
<P>
1 <= 'T' <= 1000
1 <= ‘X’ <= 10^18
Time Limit: 1 sec
</p>

```
Sample Input 1 :
2
89
870
Sample Output 1 :
2
3
Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :
In test case ‘1’. There are ‘2’ digits present in ‘89’ that is ‘8’ and ‘9’. So the answer is ‘2’.
In test case ‘2’. There are ‘3’ digits present in ‘870’ that is ‘8’, ‘7’ and ‘0’. So the answer is ‘3’.
Sample Input 2 :
2
240
1
Sample Output 2 :
3
1
```

### Solution: 

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
int countDigit(long long x) {
    // Write your code here.
    int count = 0;
    while (x>0)
    {
        count = count + 1;
        x = x/10;
    }
    return count;
}

## 7. Reverse Integer (Leetcode)

<P>Difficulty: Medium</P>

<P>
    Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321
Example 3:

Input: x = 120
Output: 21
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
</P>

### Solution: 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int reverse(int x) {
        int ReverseNumber = 0;
        while (x!=0)
        {
            int LastDigit = x %10;
            if (ReverseNumber > INT_MAX / 10 || 
               (ReverseNumber == INT_MAX / 10 && LastDigit > 7))
                return 0;

            if (ReverseNumber < INT_MIN / 10 || 
               (ReverseNumber == INT_MIN / 10 && LastDigit < -8))
                return 0;
            ReverseNumber = (ReverseNumber * 10) + LastDigit;
            x = x/10;
        }
        return ReverseNumber;
    }
};

```

## 9.Palindrome Number (LeetCode)

<P>Difficulty : Easy</P>

<P>
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
</P>

### Solution: 

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(int x) {
        int duplicate = x;
        int ReverseNumber = 0; 
        while (x > 0)
        {
            int LastDigit = x%10;
            if (ReverseNumber > INT_MAX / 10 ||
               (ReverseNumber == INT_MAX/10 && LastDigit >7))
            return 0;
            if (ReverseNumber < INT_MIN/10 ||
                (ReverseNumber == INT_MIN/10 && LastDigit < -8))
            return 0; 
            ReverseNumber = (ReverseNumber * 10) + LastDigit;         
            x = x/10;   
        }
        if (ReverseNumber == duplicate)
        {
            return true;
        } 
        else if (duplicate < 0)
        {
            return false;
        }  
        else
        { 
            return false;
        }
    }
};

##  Armstrong Number (Coding Ninjas)

<P>Difficulty: Easy</P>

<P>
Problem statement
You are given an integer ‘NUM’ . Your task is to find out whether this number is an Armstrong number or not.

A k-digit number ‘NUM’ is an Armstrong number if and only if the k-th power of each digit sums to ‘NUM’.

Example
153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3.

Therefore 153 is an Armstrong number.

Constraints:
1 <= ‘T’ <= 100
1 <= ‘N’ <= 10^9

Time Limit: 1 sec
</P>

```
Sample Input 1:
1
13
Sample Output 1:
NO
Explanation For Sample Input 1:
As 1^2 + 3^2 = 10 which is not equal to 13.So we can say it is not an Armstrong number.
Sample Input 2:
1
371
Sample Output 2:
YES
```
### Solution: 

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
bool isArmstrong(int num) {
    // Write your code here
    int duplicate = num;
    int digits = 0;
    int temp = num;
    while (temp != 0)
    {
        digits++;
        temp /=10;
    }
    int sum = 0;
    temp = num; 
    while (temp != 0)
    {
        int LastDigit = temp%10;
        sum += pow(LastDigit,digits);
        temp /=10;
    }
    return sum == duplicate;
}
```

## Print All Divisors (Coding Ninjas)

<P>Difficulty: Easy</P>

<P>
Problem statement
Given an integer ‘N’, your task is to write a program that returns all the divisors of ‘N’ in ascending order.



For example:
'N' = 5.
The divisors of 5 are 1, 5.
</P>

```
Sample Input 1 :
10
Sample Output 1 :
1 2 5 10
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
The divisors of 10 are 1,2,5,10.
Sample Input 2 :
6
Sample Output 2 :
1 2 3 6
Explanation of Sample Input 2:
The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.
Constraints :
1 <= 'N' <= 10^5
```

### Solution: 

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int* printDivisors(int n, int &size) {
    vector<int> ls;

    for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            ls.push_back(i);
            if ((n / i) != i)
                ls.push_back(n / i);
        }
    }

    sort(ls.begin(), ls.end());

    size = ls.size();          

    int* arr = new int[size]; 

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        arr[i] = ls[i];      
    }

    return arr;             
}
