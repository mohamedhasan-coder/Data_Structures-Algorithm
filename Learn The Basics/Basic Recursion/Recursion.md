## Print GFG n times ( Geeks For Geeks )
 
<P>
  Difficulty: Easy 

  Print GFG n times without the loop.
  
  Your Task:  
  
  This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function printGfg() that takes N as parameter and prints N times GFG recursively. Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.
  
  Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
  
  Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N) (Recursive).
  
  Constraint:
  1<=N<=1000

  Example:
  
  Input:
  
  5
  
  Output:
  GFG GFG GFG GFG GFG
</P>

### Solution: 

```
class Solution {
  public:
    void printGfg(int N) {
        // Code here
        if (N<=0)
           return;
        cout<<"GFG"<<" ";
        printGfg(N-1);
    }
};

## 1 to n Without Loops (Geeks For Geeks)

<P>
  Difficulty: Basic

Given an positive integer n, print numbers from 1 to n without using loops.

Implement the function printTillN() to print the numbers from 1 to n as space-separated integers.

Examples

Input: n = 5
Output: 1 2 3 4 5
Explanation: We have to print numbers from 1 to 5.
Input: n = 10
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Explanation: We have to print numbers from 1 to 10.
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
</P>

### Solution: 

```

class Solution {
  public:
    void printTillN(int n) {
        // code here
        if (n == 0)
            return;
        printTillN(n-1);
        cout<<n<<" ";
    }
};

```

## Print N to 1 without loop

<P>
  Difficulty: Easy

Print numbers from N to 1 (space separated) without the help of loops.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 10
Output: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes N as parameter and prints number from N to 1 recursively. Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N) (Recursive).

Constraint
1<=n<=1000
</P>

### Solution

```
class Solution {
  public:
    void printNos(int N) {
        // code here
        if (N <= 0)
            return;
        
        cout<<N<<" ";
        printNos(N-1);

</P>

### Solution 

```
long long sumFirstN(long long n) {

  Functional Approach
  long long sumFirstN(long long n) {
    // Write your code here.
    if (n == 0)
        return 0; 
    return n+sumFirstN(n-1);
}

class Solution {
  public:
    int factorial(int n) {
        // code here
        if (n == 0)
            return 1;
        return n * factorial(n-1);
    }

## Reverse an Array (Geeks For Geeks)

<P>
  Difficulty: Easy

  You are given an array of integers arr[]. You have to reverse the given array.

Note: Modify the array in place.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]
Output: [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]
Explanation: The elements of the array are [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]. After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position, the second element goes to the second last position and so on. Hence, the answer is [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1].
Input: arr = [4, 5, 2]
Output: [2, 5, 4]
Explanation: The elements of the array are [4, 5, 2]. The reversed array will be [2, 5, 4].
Input: arr = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The array has only single element, hence the reversed array is same as the original.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

</P>

### Solution 1: (Recursion): 

```
class Solution {
  public:
    void reverseArray(vector<int> &arr) {
        // code here
        static int i=0; 
        
        int n = arr.size();

        if (i >= n-i-1)
        {
            i = 0;
            return;
        }
        
        swap(arr[i],arr[n-i-1]);
        i++;
        reverseArray(arr);
    }
};

```
### Solution 2: (Two Pointer Iterative)
 
```
class Solution {
  public:
    void reverseArray(vector<int> &arr) {
        int l = 0, r = arr.size() - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            swap(arr[l], arr[r]);
            l++;
            r--;
        }
    }
};

## Valid Pailndrome (125.Leetcode)

<P>

  Difficulty: Easy

  A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
s consists only of printable ASCII characters.
</P>

### Solution  

```

class Solution {
public:
    bool solve(const string &s, int l, int r) {
        if (l >= r) return true;

        if (!isalnum(s[l])) return solve(s, l + 1, r);
        if (!isalnum(s[r])) return solve(s, l, r - 1);

        if (tolower(s[l]) != tolower(s[r])) return false;

        return solve(s, l + 1, r - 1);
    }

    bool isPalindrome(string s) {
        return solve(s, 0, s.size() - 1);
    }
};

## Fibonacci Number (509. Leetcode)

<P>

  Difficulty: Easy

  The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
Given n, calculate F(n).

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
Example 3:

Input: n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
 

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 30
</P>

### Solution

```
class Solution {
public:
    int fib(int n) {
        if (n<=1)
            return n;
        int last = fib(n-1);
        int slast = fib(n-2);
        return last + slast;
    }
};
